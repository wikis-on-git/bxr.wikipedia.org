'''Дэлхэйн 2-дугаар дайн'''<ref>Official military histories in Commonwealth nations refer to the conflict as the Second World War, while the United States' official histories refer to the conflict as World War II. English translations of the official histories of other nations tend to resolve into English as Second World War also, for example ''Zweiter Weltkrieg'' in German. See [[C.P. Stacey]] ''Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War'', for example. "Official" usage of these terms is giving way to popular usage and the two terms are becoming interchangeable even in formal military history.</ref> - 1939-1945 оной дайн.
