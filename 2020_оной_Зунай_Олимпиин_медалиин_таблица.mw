The design for the Olympic medals for the 2020 Summer Olympics was created by Junichi Kawanishi. The medals were manufactured using metal extracted from recycled small [[electronic device]]s donated by the public. The ribbon uses the traditional Japanese design [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] found in ''ichimatsu moyo'', a harmonised [[chequer]]ed pattern, and ''kasane no irome'', a traditional [[kimono]] layering technique, in a modern presentation. The case is manufactured from Japanese [[Fraxinus|ash wood]] dyed with the same colour as the Olympic emblem. The circular lid and the body of the case can be opened like a ring connected by a magnet.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Etchells |first1=Daniel |title=Tokyo 2020 Olympic medal designs unveiled with one-year-to-go |url=https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1082540/tokyo-2020-olympic-medal-design-unveiled |access-date=10 July 2021 |work=[[Inside the Games]] |date=24 July 2019}}</ref> The obverse of the medals features [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], the Greek goddess of victory, in front of [[Panathenaic Stadium]] and the [[Olympic rings]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Shankar |first1=Saurabh |title=Giving medals a green touch - the Tokyo 2020 way |url=https://olympics.com/en/news/giving-medals-a-green-touch-the-tokyo-2020-way |access-date=10 July 2021 |work=[[International Olympic Committee]] |date=26 July 2019}}</ref>

Due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], athletes were presented with their medals on trays and were asked to put them on themselves, rather than have them placed around their necks by a dignitary.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-07-14|title=How the Olympics will look different this year|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/how-the-olympics-will-look-different-this-year-1.5509775|access-date=2021-07-24|website=CTVNews}}</ref>

==Medal table==
{{See also|Olympic medal table}}
This is the table of the medal count of the [[2020 Summer Olympics]], based on the medal count of the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC). These rankings sort by the number of gold medals earned by a [[National Olympic Committee]] (NOC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If, after the above, countries are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by IOC Country Code. Although this information is provided by the IOC, the IOC itself does not recognize or endorse any ranking system.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stillmed.olympic.org/Documents/olympic_charter_en.pdf |title=www.olympic org Olympic Charter, p.99 |format=PDF |access-date=10 July 2021}}</ref>

The 2020 Summer Olympic program featured 33 sports with 50 disciplines, and a total of 339 events, tentatively resulting in 339 medal sets to be distributed.
